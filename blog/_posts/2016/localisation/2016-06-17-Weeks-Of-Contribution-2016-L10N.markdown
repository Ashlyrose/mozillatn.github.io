**Localization:**

Localization (L10n) objective is to improve the world by culturally adapting a product by region and locale and offering them to every user in every region throughout the world. By doing so, we create a world where the open web exists beyond linguistic, cultural, and geographical boundaries. We also pride ourselves on making sure that each user will love their experience with a product, regardless of language, culture, and region. A common man can adopt a software/tool without any language barrier.

**How it will help Mozilla Community :**

The nature of the Mozilla L10n a program is deeply rooted in collaboration between volunteer localizers and a lean team of Mozilla staff called the L10n drivers. The process that makes this collaboration efficient and strong can be described in four stages: an initial desire to localize Firefox, the actual localization work, pushing localized versions toward official release status, and maintaining Firefox while jumping into more projects.
