**What are Add-ons** 

Add-ons are exciting piece of software which are available at addons.mozilla.org for Firefox browser. They have capability to enhance browser experience and also allows us to customize our browser as per our need.

**What tools knowledge they should have before.** 

To develop Addons ( Now focussed on Web Extensions model), Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript is preferred. 
Prior Knowledge of basic operations using github will be an additional advantage.

**What’s our focus? what made us decide to have this as contribution area?**

Firefox Addons are now having a very big change. Previously we were using XUL to develop addons for Firefox, it was really very difficult to develop compared to the new Model. In new Model (Web extension model), One can develop addons using just HTML,CSS, JS and getting addons reviewed are even more faster.
We are planning to make each and every contributor basic Add-on developer and also help them to submit at least 1 Addon to AMO

**How it will help Mozilla Community** 

As said before Add-ons are helping Firefox for customization. The more add-ons we have, the more ways we can customize the browser. It is really a good time to get started with Web Extensions. We can try to create new Extension, we can port the add-ons which are already available in Firefox (from XUL model to Web Extensions model), we can try to port our favorite Extensions in Chrome to Firefox. 
Our goal is to bring a large Add-ons developer community in India. 

**How it will help when they want to be in professional way**

In software industry there are many companies who are loving to make add-ons for their Products. We are having several examples, like AdBlock, Pinterest and much more. In future people can focus more on Extensions development, so they can get amazing opportunities in Product based companies.

**When will be the training?**

*For Trainers* : **10th  & 11th August 2016**

*For New Contributors* : Trainers can work with their team by teaching them the API’s discussed, and update addons between **July 13th and July 27th** in github and also release in AMO
