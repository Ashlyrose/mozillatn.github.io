During the startup of the social media team, the stats were like

- Facebook - 419 Likes 30- Reach Avg
- Twitter -   113 Followers
- Website -  5 Visits per day Avg
- Telegram Group -  64 Members 

As a result of a collective idea from the team, Community was brought into a single group through the
integration of city level pages so we had successfully merged the various city pages of  Chennai,
Coimbatore, Villupuram, Erode, Trichy, and so on. Now all the contributors from  cities in Tamilnadu
came forward to build Mozilla Tamilnadu Community. A special mention to Gowtham Venkat and Subramanyam
who worked on this idea. The fruits of our hard work were explained by the following statistics

- 1500 Facebook Likes
- 165 Twitter Followers
- 64 followers in Telegram Channel
- 135 Members in Telegram Group
- 100+ unique visitors to MozillaTN website
- 2 Online Meetups each month
- Localizing blog posts in Tamil
- Publicising events and having online quiz

And very important reason for us to bring all these pages into single page, we can communicate news to large audience
around Tamilnadu easily, and can share to everyone whatâ€™s happening inside Tamilnadu.

An idea of conducting a quiz on the occasion of women's day from the Womoz members Ms.Ashly Rose Mathew and Bhuvana Meenakshi
was put forth; 'Womoz' quiz-an initiative through social media. The main aim of this is to encourage more women contributors
and highlight who are responding us well.

Next, myself gave an idea to Regional Ambassador Lead (Karthickeyan) of wishing Mozilla contributors on their birthday.
He came forward to collect birthday information from the contributors in Tamilnadu through Google forms, getting DOB from
Facebook and private messaging. With his massive support I started making posters for birthdays. It got an overwhelming
response.It was an encouragement to the contributors, Birthday day initiative made people have a bonding towards the community
and felt like a family.

Blogging in the regional language helps people come out of the language barrier and help them to contribute towards open web.
By blogging the post in the local language(Tamil) is very helpful for the people from the rural side and it makes them know
many things about technologies currently. they also figure it out the fears and get involved.

**Future Initiatives of Social Media Team**

Our future endeavours are in creating knowledge and awareness about FOSS in rural areas and to conduct many events regarding
Mozilla.We're planning to take it to next level by making more active contribution boost contest kinda things.

As of now, the number of unique users to MozillaTN website is very low, we are taking steps to bring contributors post in our
blog.

We have already brainstormed the ways to do Contributor Spotlight, it is as of now in inactive mode as we are busy with Weeks
of Contributions, and we are also going to start sharing the blog posts about how each and every event around Tamilnadu
happened like what are all problems Event organisers faced, what are the different outcomes and what are all the aim they had
in event, how people joined event reacted. I feel it will be giving the idea to conduct similar type of event in future easily
with minimum effort

To share the identity of each contributors we are going to quickly start about me pages in our MozillaTN website.

With theses initiatives the number of unique users visiting our website will be increased, and our MozillaTN
community will look as it is maintained by more contributors than current maintainer.
