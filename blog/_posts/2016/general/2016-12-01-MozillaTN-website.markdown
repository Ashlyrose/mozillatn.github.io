For past one year we had amazing [MozillaTN website]({{ site.url }}), and it nearly had 9K+ views in past one year. We shared lot of articles related to [Weeks of contribution]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/woc2016/) , Firefox QA [testdays]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/firefoxqa/) and more about rust, Web Literacy and so on, with the simple white page website.

We Want Change
==============

We are planning to have more information in our Index page. We really have great designers in our MozillaTN community, but we want more designers, more contributors who can share their creative thoughts in website designing to jump in. And at the same time we need more meaningful page.


What we want in our First page
==============================

- For sure we want the last 3 or 5 posts made by contributors.
- Space to Share Latest Firefox download link.
- Space to share our Social Links.
- Share important resources links based on Functional areas.


What you have to do
===================

Design an interesting Index page for MozillaTN community. You can submit your designs in by uploading the file in  [Github Issues](https://github.com/MozillaTN/mozillatn.github.io/issues/91). After you submitted your designs, make sure you bring your friends to add reactions to your designs. After submitting your design ping us in telegram.
