**Hello Everyone!**

 Monthly twice, the <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/">Quality Assurance</a> team of Mozilla conducts "test day" in which people are invited to download and test the unstable Aurora and Nightly versions of Firefox Browser for Desktop for bugs. The test day involves executing the given testcases and recording the output. 

This time, August 12th, we will be testing Firefox 49 Beta 3. We will be focusing our testing on Windows 10 compatibility, Text to Speech in Reader Mode and Text to Speech on Desktop features. Check out the detailed instructions via this <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MozillaIndiaQA-testday-20160812">etherpad</a>.

It will be a great learning and contributing experience for everyone. And hereby invite you to join us. Lets work together for a better Firefox!!!
