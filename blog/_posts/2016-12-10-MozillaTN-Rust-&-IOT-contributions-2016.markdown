- *FoxIOT Meetup series* : This was a series of 6 meetups with preplanned agendas to learn about IOT technologies and skills in Mozilla Coimbatore club.

## Ending note

Both these contibution areas are fairly new to MozillaTN community and there is a lot of excitement in the community towards learning these technologies.
