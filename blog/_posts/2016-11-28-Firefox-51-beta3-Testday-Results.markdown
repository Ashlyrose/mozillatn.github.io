**Hello All!**

<p>The  Firefox 51.0b3 Beta  Testday tookplace in November 25th. The main focus during the testing was around  WebGL2, FLAC support, Indicator for device permissions and Zoom Indicator features, bug verifications and bug triage. Before the testday, I posted a message in the Mozilla India telegram group, calling interested people to participate in this Test day.Shortly after the I sent the message, few pinged me that they are interested to join.</p>
<p>With these 18 awesome contributors, the testday was successfully done.</p>
