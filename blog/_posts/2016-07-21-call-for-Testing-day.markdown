**Hello Everyone!**

 Monthly twice, the <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/">Quality Assurance</a> team of Mozilla conducts "test day" in which people are invited to download and test the unstable Aurora and Nightly versions of Firefox Browser for Desktop for bugs. The test day involves executing the given testcases and recording the output. 

This time we will take a swing at Firefox 49.0 Aurora, this Friday, 22nd of July.  The main focus during the testing will be around Context Menu, PDF Viewer and Browser Customization. Check out the detailed instructions via this <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MozillaIndiaQA-testday-20160722">etherpad</a>.

It will be a great learning and contributing experience for everyone. And hereby invite you to join us. Lets work together for a better Firefox!!!
