**Hello All!**

<p>The  Firefox 51.0b12 Beta  Testday tookplace in january 11th. The main focus during the testing was around  WebGL 2.0, Zoom Indicator and Flash support (New version of flash in Linux â€“ 24) features, bug verifications and bug triage. Before the testday, I posted a message in the Mozilla India telegram group, calling interested people to participate in this Test day.Shortly after the I sent the message, few pinged me that they are interested to join.</p>
<p>With these 25 awesome contributors, the testday was successfully done.</p>
