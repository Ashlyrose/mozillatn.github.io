[MozillaTN]({{ site.url }}) is growing big day by day. And as per one of the goals of MozillaTN17 we are getting large number of evangelist. We should find sometime to see what our amazing contributors around Tamilnadu did in past month. Each month our community is collecting the event detail report in github under the repo [MozillaTN-events](https://github.com/MozillaTN/mozillatn-events/issues/3).

In Feb we had amazing number of events around Tamilnadu.

### Mozcafe around Tamilnadu

On Feb 5th we had MozCafe, an casual meetup by contributors to discuss about Mozilla Projects. A team at Madurai led by Sabari had a great session around 12 new contributors participated in that event and interacted, we had some of the interesting photos of this MozCafe at Madurai check in [Google Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2rPvuSnD6CeLWRBRDdjU2xOM2c). On the same day Mozillians around Salem organised a big introduction session with help of CoderDojo Salem led by Prem. It had more number of women contributors, and our WoMoz rocked the event.
