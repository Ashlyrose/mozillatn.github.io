[Activity Stream](http://bit.ly/FxAcSt) for Firefox is a collection/ bundle of things you do in browser that can  be displayed in a constructive and significant manner. This stream will make it easier to navigate through website and content faster. It helps you to rediscover the things you love the most on the web.
 
One of the feature in Activity Stream is  displaying the most viewed websites. This feature will be featured on the New Tab page. You can find this add-on in the [Test Pilot](http://bit.ly/TNFxTp) page.
 
This blog displays the most viewed website by the user (i.e the most viewed content or website used by the user). The format will be in the form of tiles where the user will click on a tile , which will link it to a specific website. At maximum, we can have 5 tiles. Each tile popping up to different websites. Each time you open a tab, youâ€™ll see your top sites based on your bookmarks and history.
