**Hello All!**

<p>The  Firefox 52a Aurora Testday tookplace in january 20th. The main focus during the testing was around Responsive Design Mode and Skia Content for Windows, bug verifications and bug triage. Before the testday, I posted a message in the Mozilla India telegram group, calling interested people to participate in this Test day.Shortly after the I sent the message, few pinged me that they are interested to join.</p>
