Hello Mozillians!

  The participation of Womoz as a team is less in our community. They mostly distribute themselves in all places. This made us to think of a way to bring them together. Following this we organised [Featured Add-ons e10s Compatibility sprint](https://mozillatn.github.io/blog/Womoz-TN-to-chip-in-Featured-Add-ons-e10s-Compatibility-sprint) focussed on Women. It was a 4 days long online sprint from 02-11-2016 to 05-11-2016.
  
 It received a warm welcome and many people turned up. We were really surprised to see many new faces who volunteered to learn about it.

 We would like to register our sincere thanks to everyone who volunteered for that and in specific the womoz who had taken up the complete task and contributed to this online sprint.

  We had a great time organising this sprint and learnt a lot through this. We felt that more than our words, the words of the participants will sound better. Pass your eyes through the words of our contributor  [Fahima Zulfath](http://womoz-e10sprint.blogspot.in/2016/11/womoz-e10s-compatibility-sprint_13.html?m=1) .
