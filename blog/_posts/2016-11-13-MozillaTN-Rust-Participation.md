## About Rust

If you are wondering what **rust** is, this blog is for your guys.

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. 

Read more about [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

## Rust Tutorials

Below are few links that are the best places to get started with rust tutorials :

* https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote
* https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorializer/blob/master/md/index.md
* https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge
* http://exercism.io/languages/rust
* https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning#tutorials--workshop-materials
* https://cis198-2016s.github.io/schedule/

Installation notes :

* https://github.com/dvigneshwer/FoxIOT_meetup_materials/tree/master/Meetup_3/rust_intro
* For installing Rust you might consider using https://www.rustup.rs/. It's slightly easier more user-friendly, and is what most experience Rust programmers use.

Ways of contributing to rust are :

* Test and learn rust, share your honest feedbacks in form of blogs etc. This will help the rust team to get developers feedback and get better insights.
* Create awesome cool documentations and code samples for people to use
* Create crates which can be really usefull developer communities as part of your projects etc
* if you know a great conference going near your region, go ahead and be an advocate of rust and brag about it


## Other Contributions
Wait now is the part where I am gonna mention about the ways people who are really want to do coding but still want to contribute to rust.

* Consider [localization](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/translations-for-rust/3126) of rust docs so that developers from various regions can learn it, wanna get started with [Tamil localization](https://github.com/dvigneshwer/Rust_Group_Coimbatore/issues/1) 
* Help advocate rust-lang to awesome developers
* Conduct great hackathons to create some really cool crate and publish at [crate site](https://crates.io)


## What's cooking in MozillaTN ?
Mozilla TN want's their contributors to be part of this rust era and contribute constanly to rust language, PFB few ways to get involved,

* Being from an analytics background I am currently working on a deep learning crate, if that sounds interesting feel free to join the club. Follow this [thread](https://github.com/dvigneshwer/Rust_Group_Coimbatore/issues/3).

* If you have made some really cool documentation or code sample which the community can use please go ahead and populate them [here](https://github.com/dvigneshwer/Rust_Group_Coimbatore/issues/2) 

if you want to conduct an rust event and not sure how to get started tweet to me at @dvigneshwer we will plan something really cool for your local developers.

As an ending note :)

* Save this snippet as main.rs
